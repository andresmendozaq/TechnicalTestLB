Not that their school, their ex-boyfriends or the world would make that easy for them. For Hanna there seems to be only one way - all or nothing. One moment everything fits: friends, clique, Hanna comes to mind. But at some point she falls in love with Jonas. Ironically, the friend of her best friend. What happens after is all very shit and Hanna is almost alone at the end: although with a new friend, but completely without her old gang. Since then nothing fits anymore.
